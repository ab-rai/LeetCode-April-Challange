/*
Difficulty Level:- 4/10 (require concepts of array manupulation )
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note:

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.
